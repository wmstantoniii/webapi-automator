# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  webapi:
    build:
      context: .
      target: final

    # expose port 80 to postman/newman for running API collection
    expose: 
      - 80
    healthcheck:
      test: "wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost/health || exit 1"
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  webapi-automator:
    image: postman/newman:alpine
    depends_on:
      webapi:
        condition: service_healthy
    # for testing (from docker exec, "wget --spider http://server/WeatherForecast")

# The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
# database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
# start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
# database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
# to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
# a password of your choosing to it before running `docker compose up`.
#     depends_on:
#       db:
#         condition: service_healthy
#   db:
#     image: postgres
#     restart: always
#     user: postgres
#     secrets:
#       - db-password
#     volumes:
#       - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
#     environment:
#       - POSTGRES_DB=example
#       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password
