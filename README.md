# webapi-automator

### WIP
### why am i doing this?
To build a fully functional container based application, including a webapi, automation, persistence, and more.

The first version has the default dotnet webapi and a postman api collection for automation.  These run in separate containers using docker compose and will be embedded in a CI/CD server, probably gitlab.
